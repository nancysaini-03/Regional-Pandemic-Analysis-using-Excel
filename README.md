## 🪞 Reflection

 - Asia maintained the highest average recovery rate of 72.30% over the observed time frame, suggesting a relatively strong recovery performance.
 - High-risk countries, as measured by COVID-19 death rate, were predominantly found in Western and Southern Europe. These were followed, in descending order of risk, by countries in Asia, Africa, South America, North America.
 - The relationship between population size and cases per 100,000 people is non-linear, as the change is not steady or proportional. This implies that variables such as health infrastructure, public policy, population density, and testing capacity—play a significant role in the spread of COVID-19 beyond just population size.
 - Vietnam is the country that appears to have handled the pandemic most efficiently.
